# alnvdl/anything

Anything is a simple web application built for when you ask your significant
other what's for dinner and the answer you get is "anything".

This app was built with Claude Opus 4.6 in GitHub Copilot in one shot using:
- [this prompt](https://gist.github.com/alnvdl/5d0d175c5a40b442048f879dc0ce4cef)
- along with a [sample `index.html`](https://gist.github.com/alnvdl/c443cdf50799a3f7a8a8b897bdfbb7db) that I partially built myself beforehand to imagine the UI, with Claude Haiku 4.5.
- and CSS files from my [`lightwebapp` stylesheet](https://github.com/alnvdl/lightwebapp/tree/fed649d9ba4902d5f83bbddf9256a06d9e93fff8).

The application worked on the first shot and I was very satisfied with the
result. Then I applied a bunch more prompts to refine the code, reviewed and
adapted the code myself in a few places, and the result is what you can see in
this repo. This is not 100% what I would have coded myself, but I wanted to
exercise how I will maintain and evolve a rather small application almost
entirely coded with an LLM.

Documentation on how to deploy and use it will be added soon.
