# alnvdl/anything

Anything is a simple web application built for the days where you ask your
significant other what's for dinner, and the answer is "anything".

This app was built with Claude Opus 4.6 in GitHub Copilot in one shot using
[this prompt](https://gist.github.com/alnvdl/5d0d175c5a40b442048f879dc0ce4cef)
along with a
[sample `index.html`](https://gist.github.com/alnvdl/c443cdf50799a3f7a8a8b897bdfbb7db) that I partially built myself, with Claude Haiku 4.5.

The sample directory also included CSS files from my
[`lightwebapp` stylesheet](https://github.com/alnvdl/lightwebapp/tree/fed649d9ba4902d5f83bbddf9256a06d9e93fff8).

Documentation on how to deploy and use it will be added soon.
